# Atarax-AI
Develop a full-featured AI assistant that runs entirely offline using llama.cpp, optimized for low-latency, high-accuracy inference on consumer-grade hardware (laptop, smartphone)

The assistant supports multi-modal inputs (text + voice + images/videos), performs real-time reasoning, and integrates with local system APIs (calendar, file system, etc.)  all with zero cloud dependency.

# Key Features

- Quantized Model Deployment: Use 4-bit or 5-bit quantization with llama.cpp to make large models run smoothly on CPU or edge devices.
- Custom Prompt Engineering Engine: Create a modular prompting system (like reusable “prompt chains”) to allow dynamic behaviors (e.g., “summarize recent emails,” “generate shell scripts,” “answer from local docs”).
- Voice Interface: Integrate Whisper.cpp for speech-to-text, making it a voice-capable offline assistant.
- Local Contextual Memory: Maintain persistent local memory (e.g., SQLite + embeddings) for personal assistant functionality.
- Privacy-First Design: No cloud calls; all processing and data storage is local. Emphasize encryption, transparency, and control.
- Smart Caching and Context Window Management: Implement sliding-window techniques, smart summarization, and embeddings to keep long-term context in RAM-limited environments.
