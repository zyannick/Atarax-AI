A Local, Privacy-Preserving AI Assistant Powered by llama.cpp

_Fully offline. Multi-modal. Secure. Yours._

Developing a full-featured AI assistant that runs entirely offline using llama.cpp, optimized for low-latency, high-accuracy inference on consumer-grade hardware (laptop, smartphone)

The assistant supports multi-modal inputs (text + voice + images/videos), performs real-time reasoning, and integrates with local system APIs (calendar, file system, etc.)  all with zero cloud dependency.
